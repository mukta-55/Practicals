            <div>
                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>The onset of effects of drugs after administration depends among other factors, on the route of
                    administration. For a drug to produce the desired effect, it is necessary to build up an effective
                    concentration in the body fluids and tissues then maintain an effective concentration for as far as
                    the desired effect is required. The concentration of the drug in the body depend on the route of
                    administration, hence rate of distribution, metabolism and excretion. Anaesthesia produced by
                    pentobarbitone is directly related to the blood concentration of the drug.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>To assess the central nervous system by noting analgesia muscular in coordination,
                            drowsiness, loss
                            of consciousness and loss of various reflexes.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>To note the recovery as an indicator of decline in levels of the drug concentration in the

                <ol>
                    <li>Drug: 50 mg/ml pentobarbitone solution.</li>
                    <li>Syringes and needles.</li>
                    <li>3 rabbits.</li>
                    <li>3 marker pens of different colors.</li>
                    <li>Weighing scale.</li>

        <!--Procedure-->
            <div>
                <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Mark each of the rabbit using the different color marker pens.</li>
                    <li>Weigh each of the rabbit and note down their weights.</li>
                    <li>Calculate the dosage to administer to each rabbit depending on their weight.</li>
                    <li>Administer the drug-pentobarbitone to the rabbits via the different routes; intravenously,
                        intraperitoneally and subcutaneously according to their weights and dose separately(administer
                        to one route per rabbit.)</li>
                    <li>Note the behavior of the rabbit after administration of pentobarbitone and the recovery of the
                        rabbit after the duration of action of the drug.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

              <!--Results--> 
            <div>
                <h3>RESULTS</h3>
                <p>On injecting one of the rabbits intravenously, it became agitated due to the pricking light pain of the needle. It lost consciousness 4 seconds after administration of pentobarbitone. It then regained consciousness after 5 minutes.</p>
                <p>On injecting on of the rabbits intraperitoneally, it became agitated due to the pricking light pain of the needle. It lost consciousness 6 minutes 4 seconds after administration of pentobarbitone. It then regained consciousness after 20 minutes.</p>
            </div>

           <!--Discussion-->
            <div>
                <h3>DISCUSSION</h3>

                    <p>
                        Calculation of dosage;<br>
                        1<sup>st</sup> rabbit <br>
                        Weight = 1.38 kg<br>
                        Dose = 30mg/kg<br>
                        pentobarbitone solution = 50mg/ml<br>
                    </p>

             <!--Conclusion-->
            <div>
               <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
               <p>Absorption of drugs via the intravenous route took the shortest time since the drug-pentobarbitone solution is directed into the bloodstream leading to rapid absorption. </p>
               <p>Absorptionof drugs via the subcutaneous route took the longest time since the subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and the injected drug is diffused very slowly at a sustained rate of absorption.</p>
