          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            The onset of effects of drugs after administration depends among
            other factors, on the route of administration. For a drug to produce
            the desired effect, it is necessary to build up an effective
            concentration in the body fluids and tissues then maintain an
            effective concentration for as far as the desired effect is
            required. The concentration of the drug in the body depend on the
            route of administration, hence rate of distribution, metabolism and
            excretion. Anaesthesia produced by pentobarbitone is directly
            related to the blood concentration of the drug.

              On injecting one of the rabbits intravenously, it became agitated

              consciousness 4 seconds after administration of pentobarbitone. It
              then regained consciousness after 5 minutes.

              On injecting on of the rabbits intraperitoneally, it became

              consciousness 6 minutes 4 seconds after administration of

          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            Absorption of drugs via the intravenous route took the shortest time
            since the drug-pentobarbitone solution is directed into the
            bloodstream leading to rapid absorption.
          </p>
          <p>
            Absorptionof drugs via the subcutaneous route took the longest time
            since the subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and the injected
            drug is diffused very slowly at a sustained rate of absorption.

          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Hot plate method</strong>: Pain is very difficult to define
            and measure. It is known for sure if noxious stimulus is applied to
            an animal, it approximates the nervous stimulus of pain experienced
            by man.
          </p>
          <p>
            By far the most commonly used method in assessment of analgesia is
            the hot plate method.
          </p>

          <h3>PROCEDURE</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>
              The mice was weighed, then the dosage of the drug(morphine) to be
              administered was calculated.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hot plate was maintained at a constant temperature between
              50<sup>o</sup>c and 55<sup>o</sup>c.
            </li>
            <li>
              The mice was placed on the hot plate before it was injected with
              morphine and the time the mice took before showing the response
              was noted.
            </li>
            <li>
              The other different mice were also placed on the hot plate and the
              time of their response was also noted. The mice was also injected
              with morphine and allowed to stand for few minutes for the drug to
              begin its action, then put on a hot plate and the time taken by
              the mice also noted.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            The procedure was repeated on the two mice and the time taken by
            each mouse to show response was noted.
          </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Morphine has analgesic effect that helped the mice not to feel
                any external stimuli(heat and pain.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The response of the mice can be attributed to the administration
                of morphineto human beings before surgery to reduce the pain and
                also not to feel any painduring surgical procedure. However,
                during labour pethidine and other drugs are not advised than
                morphine.
